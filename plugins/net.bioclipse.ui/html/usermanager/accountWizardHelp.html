<h1>Creating a new user account</h1>
The creation of a Bioclipse account and addition of a third-part account can be
done in two ways: Either from <b>Window > Preferences... > Users</b>, see <a
href="usingPrefs.html">Using Preferences</a>. Or by using the wizard found under
<b>File > New... > Account</b>. The wizard is described below.
<br><br>
<a name="Wizard"><h2>Using the wizard</h2></a>
This is probably the easiest way, especially if you don't have any Bioclipse
user-account yet. If you can't find this alternative, it's probably because you
don't have any feature that needs a login installed. Features are simple to
install from <b>Install > New Feature</b>, see also the section <a
href="../tutorials/updating.html">Installing new feature</a> in Bioclipse's
users manual.

<h3>Creating a new user account</h3>
If you don't have any user account then the first thing the wizard will ask you
to do is to create one. This is done by writing your chosen username in the top
field, then a password in the next and at last repeat the password in the
bottom-field. Then click the next button, to continue with adding a third-part
account to your newly created user-account (see further in the section <a
href="#Wizard3part">Add a third-part account</a> below).<br> If there already
exists one or more user-accounts the wizard will ask you to login, do so. Or if
you for some reason wants to create a new account; click on the button with the
label <b>Create new account...</b> to the left beneath the password-field, this
will show a dialog where you can create a new user-account in the same way as
described above. After you either logged in or created a new account, the wizard
will continue to the next step where you can add a third-part account.<br>
Observe that if you already are logged in to an user-account the wizard will
skip this step.

</table>
After creating a new user-account, or logging in to one, it's now time to add a
new third-part account to your user-account. First choose the account-type, i.e.
which of the installed features web-services that you want to add a
login to. This is done in the dropdown-menu at the top of the window. Only the
installed features that have have a web-service are visibly. Observe that you
can only have one account of each type for each Bioclipse account.<br> 
In the filed with the label "Account name" in-front of it is the name of this
third-part account, but you can choose another name and write that in this field
instead. In the fields below you add the information that is needed for
Bioclipse to be able to login to the web-service. As stated in the
introduction, it will in most cases be a field for our username and one for the
password to the service. Fill in those fields, and then click the finish-button.
The wizard will now login to your Bioclipse account and you will see a green
padlock in status line at the bottom of the Bioclipse window.<br> 
If some reason Bioclipse failed to login to any of your third-part accounts,
you will get a dialog telling you which of them that failed. See more about that
in the section <a href="loginoutHelp.html">Logging in and out</a>.
