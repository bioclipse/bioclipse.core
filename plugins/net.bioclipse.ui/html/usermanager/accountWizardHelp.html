<h1>Creating a new user account</h1>
The creation of a Bioclipse account and adding the third-part account can be
done in two ways: Either from <b>Window > Preferences... > Users</b>, see <a
href="usingPrefs.html">Using Preferences</a>. Or by using the wizard you find
under <b>File > New... > Account</b>. The wizard is described below.
<br><br>
<a name="Wizard"><h2>Using the wizard</h2></a>
This is probably the easiest way, especially if you don't have any Bioclipse
user-account yet. If you can't find this alternative, it's probably because you
don't have any feature that needs a log-in installed. Features are simple to
install from <b>Help > Install new Bioclipse feature</b>, see also the section
<a href="../tutorials/updating.html">Installing new feature</a> in Bioclipses
users manual.

<h3>Creating a new user account</h3>
If you don't have any user account then the first thing the wizard will ask you
is to create one. This is done by writing your chosen username in the top field,
then a password in the next and at last repeat the password in the bottom-field.
Then click the next button, to continue with adding a third-part account to your
newly created user-account (see further in the section <a
href="#Wizard3part">Add a third-part account</a> below).<br> If there already
exists one or more user-accounts the wizard will ask you to log-in, do so. Or if
you for some reason wants to create a new account; click on the button with the
label <b>Create new account...</b> to the left beneath the password-field, this
will show a dialog where you can create a new user-account in the same way as
described above. After you either logged in or created a new account, the wizard
will continue to the next step where you can add a third-part account.<br>
Observe that if you already are logged in to an user-account the wizard will
skip this step.

</table>
After creating a new user-account, or logged in to one, it's now time to add a
new third-part account to your user-account. First choose the account-type, i.e.
which of the installed features web-services that it is that you want to add a
log in to. This is done in the dropdown-menu at the top of the window. Only the
installed features that have have an web- service are visibly. Observe that you
can only have one account type per Bioclipse account.<br> In the filed with the
label "Account name" in-front of it is the name of this third-part account, but
you can choose another name and write that in this field instead. In the fields
below you add the information that is needed for Bioclipse to be able to log in
to the web-service. As stated in the introduction, it will in most cases be a
field for our username and one for the password to the service. Fill in those
fields, and then click the finish-button. The wizard will now log in to your
Bioclipse account and you will see a green padlock in status line at the bottom
of the Bioclipse window.<br> If some reason Bioclipse failed to log-in to any of
your third-part accounts, you will get a dialog telling you which of them that
failed. See more about that in the section <a href="loginoutHelp.html">Logging
in and out</a>.
