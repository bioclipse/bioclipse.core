* default artifact locator picks up Maven 2 ~/.m2/settings.xml localRepository configuration

  is misconfigured or the logging classes are not loaded yet

---------------------------------------

General
* removed deprecated methods

* by default, the samples and integration tests are not executed (use Maven profiles to include them)
* Maven 2.0.7 is required for properly building the project under JDK 1.6

Package org.springframework.osgi

* updated spring-osgi.xsd list, set elements to properly reflect OsgiServiceCollectionFactoryBean package

Package org.springframework.osgi.context
* AbstractDelegatedExecutionApplicationContext throws clearer exception when the mandatory BundleContext is not set

Package org.springframework.osgi.extender
* META-INF/spring.handlers, META-INF/spring.schemas files are searched in the bundle space instead of the class space

Package org.springframework.osgi.service
* fixed double negation in AutoExport.DISABLED javadoc
* removed deprecated method AbstractOsgiServiceImportFactoryBean#setInterface

* AbstractConfigurableBundleCreatorTests exposes the default jar creation settings through #getDefaultSettings()
* removed method AbstractDependencyManagerTests#injectArtifactLocator 
* AbstractDependencyManagerTests#getLocator visibility changed from public to protected
* AbstractConfigurableBundleCreatorTests jar content pattern has been changed to **/* (from **/*.class, **/*.xml, 
  **/*.properties)
* waitOnContextCreation methods visibility changed from public to protected (to be consistent with the rest of the
  test methods)
